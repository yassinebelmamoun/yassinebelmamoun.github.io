The next Flex version will be 3.0 and it will bring a few changes to the theme structure, introducing a few configuration changes.
Over the years many features were added to Flex theme and some with not much care.
Because of this, code cleanup is needed to allow theme maintenance in the future.
Pelican also changed, and some features present in Flex are now available in Pelican or as new plugins. It's time to review everything done so far.

Hope you enjoy this version and stay tuned for Flex 3.0.
